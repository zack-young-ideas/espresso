## Installation

After cloning a copy of the repository, run `npm run build` to install
all dependencies and initialize some important settings.

## Usage

After installation, the `npm start` command will start a local server
that hosts the blog application. Open a Web browser and visit
http://localhost:3000 to begin the setup process. You will be prompted
to enter the login credentials for the database and come up with a
username and password for the site's admin user. The application
requires a MongoDB database in order to work--currently, no other
database management systems are supported.
